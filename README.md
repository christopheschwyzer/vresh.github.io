## Test site locally

Make sure to install dependencies
```
bundle install
npm install
```
Build the site and serve it on `http://localhost:4000`
```
grunt develop
```
â€¦this will also watch for changes, rebuild and trigger a *live reload*.

## Use docker

- install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- run `docker-compose up` in this repo

You should have the website running on `http://localhost:4000` normally :)
